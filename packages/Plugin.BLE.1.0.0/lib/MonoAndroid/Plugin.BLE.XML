            <summary>
            we have to keep a reference to this because Android's api is weird and requires
            the GattServer in order to do nearly anything, including enumerating services
            
            TODO: consider wrapping the Gatt and Callback into a single object and passing that around instead.

            <summary>
            we also track this because of gogole's weird API. the gatt callback is where
            we'll get notified when services are enumerated
